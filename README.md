sorry if updates are slow i am currently working on a flutter project a lot this is not on github

# os this is my vision as to how an os should work in the backend
what happens when you press the power button the computer will run the first pyton flie it sees this will be first startup.py
this file will run the create user function from the usermanagement module and then delete itself using the files module
this means on the next boot the startup.py will run as it will be the first item the computer sees.
thus file will run the sign in function from the user management module.
